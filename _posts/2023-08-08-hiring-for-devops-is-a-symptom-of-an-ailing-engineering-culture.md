Let's face it, 2023 is the reign of quantity (if you're interested in the metaphysical explanation, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reign_of_Quantity_and_the_Signs_of_the_Times" target="_blank">
The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times
</a> by René Guénon is a must-read). 
Most people want to be data-driven because it's trendy (whether that really changes anything for the better is irrelevant, unfortunately). 
If you've read the article on <a href="https://binaryreads.com/2023/07/09/the-myth-of-the-full-stack-developer.html">The Myth of the Full Stack Developer</a>, you are probably 
aware of how the idea that *more engineers are better* came about.

DevOps is simply a capability. And if you are hiring for DevOps engineers or building a DevOps team, you've likely missed the point. In fact, having to hire separate people
to fill the role of DevOps is a symptom of an ailing engineering culture, and as a good leader, you should be looking to fix the culture. Because like the majority of workplace 
problems, the solutions don't lie in data or metrics or quantitative aspects, but they lie in the people, their culture, and their values (the qualitative aspects).

Let's qualify the statement that **DevOps is a Capability**, not a role.

DevOps is simply a blend of 2 terms - Development and Operations. Historically, both of these were departments in companies and operated in isolation. 
The development team would build software and then throw it over the wall to the operations team to deploy and maintain. 
This created a lot of friction and problems for a variety of obvious reasons. I don't think anything more needs to be said about why creating a separate 
DevOps team or department basically defeats the very purpose of DevOps (and in-case you missed it, the intent is to break down the wall).

A little step back in time will help us understand the catalysts of the 'DevOps' capability.

The first is the evolution of Agile software development. I use this carefully because in various organisations around the world, agile is still used as a verb, 
so the understanding is rudimentary, to say the least. In particular, it's the definition of customer value within user stories that enforces a DevOps mindset. Each user story
must deliver customer value. A story is not complete until it is deployed in production. This means that to efficiently deliver customer value, a developer must be able to 
do the part of development as well as operations, because a story that is not productionised does not deliver any value. To do this, we need developers with the DevOps capability. Having 
different people do jobs or developer and operations in the same team is tantamount to a mini-waterfall - it's pretence and does not work.

The second is the coining of the paradigm 'You build it, you run it' by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels in 2016. It means that a developer is now responsible for the lifecycle of the product 
and should not only deliver customer value, but ensure that the product continues to deliver customer value. In organisations where DevOps is a separate role as opposed to another 
capability in a developer's toolbox, supporting applications in production environments is a terribly inefficient process. All too often you see conference calls with 10 people from 10 
different departments, each with their own agenda, trying to figure out what went wrong and who to blame for it before even trying to fix it. The quote from Werner Vogels will help
understand the value of DevOps as a capability:

> “Giving developers operational responsibilities has greatly enhanced the quality of the services, both from a customer and a technology point of view. 
> The traditional model is that you take your software to the wall that separates development and operations and throw it over and then forget about it. 
> Not at Amazon. *You build it, you run it*. This brings developers into contact with the day-to-day operation of their software. It also brings them into 
> day-to-day contact with the customer. This customer feedback loop is essential for improving the quality of the service.”

Are you a technology leader who is building DevOps teams? Perhaps it's time to look at your engineering culture and see if you can fix it instead.
