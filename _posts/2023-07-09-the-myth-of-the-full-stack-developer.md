Perhaps you have heard this statement before - a full-stack developer is a _myth_. If you are one, it might even invoke some kind of
reaction within you. But before you react and all that coffee we drink as full-stack developers manifests itself into reactive energy, 
let's take a couple of minutes understand what a myth actually is, and how the above is, indeed, a statement of fact.

Etymologically, the word _myth_ in English comes from the Greek word _mythos_, which means "report" or "tale" or "true narrative", 
referring not only to the means by which it was transmitted but also to its being rooted in *T*ruth. Of course, as time unfolds and 
we stumble upon the profanity that modern times brings with it, we have come to associate the word _myth_ with something that is 
false, or something that is not true. But that is not what it means. In fact, a modern dictionary gives 2 meanings for the word myth:

  1. A traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events.
  2. A widely held but false belief or idea.

So the modern definition can be classified as nothing more than a deformation of what the actual word means (not withstanding 
the difference between the Greek words Mythos and Logos, but that's another _form of binary philosophy / theosophy_ we eon't explore); it, in fact, appears to be
a negation of the truth that the original Greek word actually purported. And as mythos is how knowledge was transmitted (and still is the most
effective way of transmitting it), for those who understand the religious efficacy of mythos, one might even corelate it with the use of the word
isnad (إِسْنَاد) in Arabic or Upanishad (उपनिषद्) in Sanskrit. But that is a topic for another day.

It should already be quite obvious that by calling a full-stack developer a myth, we are in fact affirming that such 
developers or engineers exist. So why do people still make this statement? 

Binary alert - there are 2 kinds of companies working with technology these days:

  1. Those that formed or inherited their IT teams or departments and their IT Leadership from Managed Service Providers (MSPs) - 
  I don't need to name these MSPs, but you know who they are. These companies are the ones that still want to be delivery centric. Their
  software teams are _managed_ by delivery managers, and their income was based on the number of people they could bill to their clients.
  These companies were notorious (and still are, but we are not talking about MSPs for the sake of this article) for 'creating' a separate
  job role for each and every capability that a software engineer needs to ship anything that delivers real customer value. And so we 
  have a back-end developer, a front-end developer, an Operations Engineer, a DevOps Engineer, a Database Administrator, a Database Engineer...
  you get the gist. And so, in these companies, the myth (for once we can entertain the modern definition) of the full-stack developer is perpetuated.
  2. Those that formed their IT teams or departments from the ground up. These companies understand that software engineering is not a 
  separate function, but a way of working. They embrace the idea of full-stack engineers, and they understand that the only way to deliver
  real customer value with quality and on-time is to have engineers who can work on the entire stack, and not just a part of it.

You'll find that the first kind of companies are the ones that are still struggling to deliver value to their customers and they 
have excessively large Software departments (they're also usually large enterprises with little intertia).

The second kind of companies are the ones that are able to deliver value to their customers, and they have small, nimble, and
highly effective Software departments (they're usually startups or small to medium-sized enterprises).

So we might say that this a statement made in error by those who are victimised by the baggage of MSPs and their ways of working.

We'll leave the discussion around I-shaped, T-shaped and E-shaped developers for another day, too.
